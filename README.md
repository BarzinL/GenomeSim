> **First-principles genomic analysis with epistemic humility**

GenomeSim is an open-source platform for analyzing whole genome sequences from first principles. Unlike traditional genomics tools that rely heavily on existing annotations, GenomeSim performs **ab initio analysis** — starting only with sequence data and biochemical rules to predict genes, regulatory elements, and functional annotations.

## 🎯 Core Innovation

**Every prediction includes explicit confidence scores** showing exactly which evidence supports it and where uncertainty remains. This "epistemic humility" approach makes GenomeSim ideal for:

- **Underrepresented populations** where reference databases are inadequate
- **Novel organisms** with no existing annotations
- **Research contexts** requiring transparent uncertainty quantification
- **Clinical applications** where confidence levels are critical

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔬 **Ab Initio Analysis**: Start from raw sequence, no reference genome required
- 📊 **Epistemic Humility**: Every prediction includes explicit confidence scores
- 🔌 **Plugin Architecture**: Swap analyzers, add new methods, combine approaches
- 📝 **Provenance Tracking**: Complete record of how every result was obtained
- 🎨 **Desktop Application**: Visual genome browser with interactive confidence visualization (coming in Phase 3)
- 🧬 **Multi-Scale Integration**: Analyze from nucleotides to phenotypes
- 🤖 **ML Integration**: Seamlessly combine traditional + machine learning methods

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BarzinL/GenomeSim.git
cd GenomeSim

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests to verify installation
pytest
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from genomesim.core import SequenceScale, AnalysisType
from genomesim import Confidence, Provenance, GenomicFeature

# Define your sequence
sequence = "ATGCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG..."

# More analyzers coming in Phase 1!
# Example workflow (pseudocode):
# from genomesim.analyzers import ORFFinder, MotifScanner, GeneFinder
#
# # Find ORFs
# orf_finder = ORFFinder(min_length=100)
# orfs = orf_finder.analyze(sequence)
#
# # Find regulatory motifs
# motif_scanner = MotifScanner()
# motifs = motif_scanner.analyze(sequence)
#
# # Integrate evidence into gene predictions
# gene_finder = GeneFinder()
# genes = gene_finder.analyze(sequence, orfs=orfs, motifs=motifs)
#
# # Inspect confidence
# for gene in genes:
#     print(f"{gene.attributes['name']}: {gene.confidence.score:.2f}")
#     print(f"  Evidence: {gene.confidence.supporting_evidence}")
```

## 📖 Philosophy

### 1. Epistemic Humility

Every prediction quantifies its uncertainty. No result is presented without explicit confidence bounds and evidence breakdown.

```python
# Every feature includes detailed confidence information
feature.confidence.score  # 0.0 to 1.0
feature.confidence.method  # How was it computed?
feature.confidence.sources  # What contributes to uncertainty?
feature.confidence.supporting_evidence  # What evidence supports this?
```

### 2. Multi-Scale Integration

Genomic features exist across scales: **Nucleotide → Motif → Domain → Gene → Operon → Pathway → Phenotype**

Analysis at each scale informs the next, with uncertainty propagating upward.

### 3. Complete Provenance

Every result knows:
- Which analyzer produced it
- What parameters were used
- Which data sources contributed
- How confidence was computed

### 4. Plugin Architecture

All analysis methods are pluggable modules. Users can:
- Swap implementations
- Add new analyzers
- Combine methods
- Compare approaches

## 🎓 Core Concepts

### Sequence Scales

```python
from genomesim.core import SequenceScale

SequenceScale.NUCLEOTIDE   # Individual bases
SequenceScale.MOTIF        # 6-20 bp patterns (TFBS, splice sites)
SequenceScale.DOMAIN       # Functional units
SequenceScale.GENE         # Complete genes
SequenceScale.OPERON       # Gene clusters
SequenceScale.CHROMOSOME   # Full chromosomes
SequenceScale.GENOME       # Complete genomes
```

### Analysis Types

```python
from genomesim.core import AnalysisType

AnalysisType.STRUCTURAL      # What's physically there?
AnalysisType.COMPOSITIONAL   # What's the makeup?
AnalysisType.FUNCTIONAL      # What does it do?
AnalysisType.EVOLUTIONARY    # How did it get here?
AnalysisType.REGULATORY      # How is it controlled?
```

### Core Interfaces

**SequenceAnalyzer**: Base class for all genomic analyzers
- Performs specific analysis on DNA/RNA sequences
- Must compute explicit confidence scores
- Tracks complete provenance

**ScaleBridge**: Integrates features across scales
- Combines evidence from multiple lower-scale features
- Aggregates confidence scores appropriately
- Enables multi-scale analysis
